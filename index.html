        <h2>Data Reporting Analyst / Escalation Technician Lead</h2>
        <h3>Heartland Payment Systems</h3>
        <h4>August 2011 - September 2014 | Jeffersonville, IN</h4>
        <p>In this position, I manage the daily operational and reporting responsibilities for the Network Operations Center of a national call center for a Fortune 1000 business. My team is the first responder to business-impacting issues, which includes performing troubleshooting of reported issues to verify impact, analyze the potential affected areas, and alert the appropriate groups for resolution. I work closely with individuals across all departments and offices of the business to address and resolve business-impacting issues. My team and I are responsible for analyzing business data and providing metrics on business-impacting issues to multiple department leaders and managers. I currently develop and maintain hundreds of analytical business reports within SAP Crystal Reports 2011 and SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 R2 using Visual Studio 2008/2012, in conjunction with our corporate Business Intelligence team. I also mentor team members on writing and executing T-SQL queries to allow them to research and provide more accurate information for business-impacting issues.</p>
        <p>A summary of reporting accomplishments include call statistic reporting for over 900 employees within a national call center, financial reporting of account and margin earnings of sales representatives, performance reporting for three ticket and call logging systems utilized across multiple departments and offices, auditing reports that provide analysis of user access levels to multiple business applications, custom reports created from requests received from business managers, and the redesign of many legacy reports with new data layouts and themes to enhance the user experience.

        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>The following is a summary of my experience with various software development environments:</p>
        <h2>Front-End Web Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I used HTML and CSS for two years while developing content for internal CMS at Heartland Payment Systems.</li>
          <li>I taught myself how to create multiple Chrome Extensions for internal website monitoring at Heartland Payment Systems.</li>
          <li>I utilized knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery to develop the content and functionality of these extensions. x Along with the Bootstrap front-end framework, I designed custom front-end content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Incentivator, a task assignment and incentive application that was to be used for tracking chores assigned to my children.</li>
          <li>As a final project for my front-end web development work with Code Louisville, I am developing a personal website at http://sachtleben.me that will showcase my experience, projects, and skills. I have developed all content within the site, and I have designed the site using responsive CSS.</li>
          <li>At Stored Value Solutions, I administered an enterprise service management software suite called ServiceNow. I was responsible for developing front-end form content as well as custom JavaScript code that interfaces with ServiceNow's core processes to deliver enhancements to the site through the use of Client Scripts, Business Rules, Access Control Lists, and many other various system objects</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Back-End Web Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>During my last year at Sullivan University, I taught myself the fundamentals of PHP to create a functioning back-end framework for a bug-tracking system that was submitted as a final group project.</li>
          <li>I conceptualized, designed, and built using PHP the back-end framework of the Incentivator, a task assignment and incentive application that was to be used for tracking chores assigned to my children.</li>
          <li>I created a Twitter bot that gathers all tweets from a specific username, stores the relevant tweet data in JSON format, and analyzes the data using a Markov chain algorithm to generate sentences that matches a similar sentence structure of the user.</li>
          <li>To create a way to restrict access to the wireless internet connection at my house, I have created a C# console application that uses TCP sockets to connect to my wireless router and generate a new wireless password.  I plan to schedule the console application to execute at a certain interval to generate, set, and store a new password that will be accessible by a website that can be accessed from a computer already on the network.  The website will have the user answer a trivia or logic question that is generated from a database of available questions that my wife and I populate.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Database Programming</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I used my knowledge of MySQL to design and implement a relational database that was used in conjunction with the PHP back-end framework for a bug-tracking system.</li>
          <li>Within a short time frame, I taught myself many T-SQL queries such as complex SQL queries for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting database information, stored procedures used for complex query utilization, views for controlled data queries performed by other users, and triggers to allow updates of other table data when the data of a table is updated.</li>
          <li>I applied knowledge of T-SQL to provide reporting services for Heartland Payment Systems for three years. Along with SSMS for ad-hoc query execution, I utilized Visual Studio 2012 and SSRS 2008 R2, Crystal Reports 2011, and VBA within Excel to generate dynamic, informative reporting of business metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other Programming Projects</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I have created multiple test projects within C# for various classroom projects.</li>
          <li>I developed a C# version of a "Savings Calculator" that displayed the number of dollars Heartland Payment Systems passed through to its merchants from Durbin Amendment savings based on calculated dollar savings per second. This was built to so I could estimate the date that the savings counter would hit milestone dollar amounts.</li>
          <li>I developed a small pong-style video game in C# as a final solo project at Sullivan University</li>
          <li>I have created some small Android applications utilizing Java and XML markup for content layout.</li>
          <li>Using Java and libGDX, I created a small 2D game called Police Box.</li>
          <li>I have utilized online tutorials for other games developed in Java to further my knowledge of the language.</li>
          <li>I wrote a IIS weblog parser that takes IIS web logs, removes the IIS log header information, and separates the fields into tab-delimited log files that can be either viewed in a Winforms application and/or can be exported into a log file for use with Microsoft Excel or other editor.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I have acquired a fundamental understanding of Git and how it can be used for proper version control within the confines of the software development lifecycle. I have used Git to track various personal projects of mine, and they can be viewed at my <a href="https://github.com/joshuasachtleben">GitHub Page.</a></li>
          <li>I currently work with Team Foundation Server (TFS) professionally.  I have started utilizing it for personal projects both to further my experience with the version control software as well as to integrate source control usage within Visual Studio.</li>
