                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>Over the last <span id="years">7</span> years, I have acquired a wide range of software development skills.  I obtained a strong foundation in software development through my education at Sullivan University, and I have worked to continue building upon that knowledge with dedicated self-study and practical application both in the workplace and with personal projects.</p>
                <p>While continuing to learn and improve competencies required to accomplish core responsibilities at Heartland Payment Systems and Stored Value Solutions, I have spent my free time researching JavaScript and responsive CSS to create useful, dynamic websites.  I have also studied other programming languages including Java and C# to both hone skills I acquired from Sullivan University as well as broaden my experience with object-oriented programming and back-end frameworks.</p>
                <p>Currently, I am participating in the Code Louisville training program to refresh my existing knowledge of web development technologies.  Some of the content covered so far has been learning how to build a responsive website framework with HTML 5 and CSS3, discovering how to use JavaScript/jQuery to enhance page interactivity, and using AJAX to exchange data with web servers.</p>

                <h3>Stored Value Solutions</h3>
                <h4>September 2014 - Present | Louisville, KY</h4>
                <p>As a part of the IT Service Management team at Stored Value Solutions, I function as the ServiceNow Developer and Administrator.  I partner with business leaders and process owners to architect and develop new applications, forms, and process flows for the company's ServiceNow platform.  I maintain existing ServiceNow content and workflows, and I administer access within the site.  I create custom JavaScript code that interfaces with ServiceNow's core processes to deliver enhancements to the site.  I partner with end users to assist with issues that arise with ServiceNow.  I assist in the management and improvement of IT processes of the ITIL lifecycle including Incident, Problem, Change, and Configuration Management.</p>

                <h1>Portfolio</h1>
                <p>The following is a summary of my experience with various software development environments:</p>
              <h2>Front-End Web Development</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>I used HTML and CSS for two years while developing content for internal CMS at Heartland Payment Systems.</li>
                <li>I taught myself how to create multiple Chrome Extensions for internal website monitoring at Heartland Payment Systems.</li>
                <li>I utilized knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery to develop the content and functionality of these extensions. x Along with the Bootstrap front-end framework, I designed custom front-end content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Incentivator, a task assignment and incentive application that was to be used for tracking chores assigned to my children.</li>
                <li>As a final project for my front-end web development work with Code Louisville, I am developing a personal website at http://sachtleben.me that will showcase my experience, projects, and skills.  I have developed all content within the site, and I have designed the site using responsive CSS.</li>
                <li>At Stored Value Solutions, I administered an enterprise service management software suite called ServiceNow.  I was responsible for developing front-end form content as well as custom JavaScript code that interfaces with ServiceNow's core processes to deliver enhancements to the site through the use of Client Scripts, Business Rules, Access Control Lists, and many other various system objects</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Back-End Web Development</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>During my last year at Sullivan University, I taught myself the fundamentals of PHP to create a functioning back-end framework for a bug-tracking system that was submitted as a final group project.</li>
                <li>I conceptualized, designed, and built using PHP the back-end framework of the Incentivator, a task assignment and incentive application that was to be used for tracking chores assigned to my children.</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Database Programming</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>I used my knowledge of MySQL to design and implement a relational database that was used in conjunction with the PHP back-end framework for a bug-tracking system.</li>
                <li>Within a short time frame, I taught myself many T-SQL queries such as complex SQL queries for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting database information, stored procedures used for complex query utilization, views for controlled data queries performed by other users, and triggers to allow updates of other table data when the data of a table is updated.</li>
                <li>I applied knowledge of T-SQL to provide reporting services for Heartland Payment Systems for three years.   Along with SSMS for ad-hoc query execution, I utilized Visual Studio 2012 and SSRS 2008 R2, Crystal Reports 2011, and VBA within Excel to generate dynamic, informative reporting of business metrics.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Other Programming Languages</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>I have created multiple test projects within C# for various classroom projects.</li>
                <li>I developed a C# version of a "Savings Calculator" that displayed the number of dollars Heartland Payment Systems passed through to its merchants from Durbin Amendment savings based on calculated dollar savings per second.  This was built to so I could estimate the date that the savings counter would hit milestone dollar amounts.</li>
                <li>I developed a small pong-style video game in C# as a final solo project at Sullivan University</li>
                <li>I have created some small Android applications utilizing Java and XML markup for content layout.</li>
                <li>Using Java and libGDX, I created a small 2D game called Police Box.</li>
                <li>I have utilized online tutorials for other games developed in Java to further my knowledge of the language.</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>I have acquired a fundamental understanding of Git and how it can be used for proper version control within the confines of the software development lifecycle.  I have used Git to track various personal projects of mine, and they can be viewed at my <a href="https://github.com/joshuasachtleben">GitHub Page</a></li>
