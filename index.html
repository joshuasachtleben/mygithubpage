        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Over the last <span id="years">7</span> years, I have acquired a wide range of software development skills. I obtained a strong foundation in software development through my education at Sullivan University, and I have worked to continue building upon that knowledge with dedicated self-study and practical application both in the workplace and with personal projects.</p>
        <p>While continuing to learn and improve competencies required to accomplish core responsibilities at Heartland Payment Systems and Stored Value Solutions, I have spent my free time researching JavaScript and responsive CSS to create useful, dynamic websites. I have also studied other programming languages including Java and C# to both hone skills I acquired from Sullivan University as well as broaden my experience with object-oriented programming and back-end frameworks.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am participating in the Code Louisville training program to refresh my existing knowledge of web development technologies. Some of the content covered so far has been learning how to build a responsive website framework with HTML 5 and CSS3, discovering how to use JavaScript/jQuery to enhance page interactivity, and using AJAX to exchange data with web servers.</p>

        <h2>Data Reporting Analyst / Escalation Technician Lead</h2>
        <h3>Heartland Payment Systems</h3>
        <h4>August 2011 - September 2014 | Jeffersonville, IN</h4>
        <p>In this position, I manage the daily operational and reporting responsibilities for the Network Operations Center of a national call center for a Fortune 1000 business. My team is the first responder to business-impacting issues, which includes performing troubleshooting of reported issues to verify impact, analyze the potential affected areas, and alert the appropriate groups for resolution. I work closely with individuals across all departments and offices of the business to address and resolve business-impacting issues. My team and I are responsible for analyzing business data and providing metrics on business-impacting issues to multiple department leaders and managers. I currently develop and maintain hundreds of analytical business reports within SAP Crystal Reports 2011 and SQL Server Reporting Services 2008 R2 using Visual Studio 2008/2012, in conjunction with our corporate Business Intelligence team. I also mentor team members on writing and executing T-SQL queries to allow them to research and provide more accurate information for business-impacting issues.</p>
        <p>A summary of reporting accomplishments include call statistic reporting for over 900 employees within a national call center, financial reporting of account and margin earnings of sales representatives, performance reporting for three ticket and call logging systems utilized across multiple departments and offices, auditing reports that provide analysis of user access levels to multiple business applications, custom reports created from requests received from business managers, and the redesign of many legacy reports with new data layouts and themes to enhance the user experience. I also learned how to administer a SSRS server to provide security administration for reporting, to administer recurring reporting, and to back up report files and encryption keys.</p>
        <h2>Website Administrator</h2>
        <h3>Heartland Payment Systems</h3>
        <h4>June 2008 - April 2010 | Jeffersonville, IN</h4>
        <p>While also seeing to the responsibilities of a Customer Advocate, I also created, updated, and maintained site pages for wiki.heartlandpaymentsystems.com using CSS and HTML. I coordinated with the Training Department and various department Directors to identify needed content for the Wiki website and publish said content within pre-determined time frames. I create new site content like screenshots, logos, and technical reference material using Adobe Photoshop and Acrobat as well as Microsoft Word and Excel. I led design efforts for site pages, content and images. I also provided technical support for usability issues and critical site problems, as needed.</p>
        <h2>Customer Advocate - Urgent Care Team</h2>
        <h3>Heartland Payment Systems</h3>
        <h4>May 2006 - August 2011 | Jeffersonville, IN</h4>
        <p>As a member of the Urgent Care Team, I analyzed each customer call received at the help desk to efficiently and effectively troubleshoot and resolve their issue in order to reduce the impact to the customerâ€™s sales as well as provide exceptional levels of customer service. I successfully maintained ACD call statistics well below the maximum allotted time frames. I properly escalated any issue beyond my ability to resolve by either calling or e-mailing the appropriate escalation point and providing all attempted troubleshooting procedures. I monitored any escalated issues I was involved with to ensure proper resolution occurred.</p>

        <h1>Portfolio</h1>
        <p>The following is a summary of my experience with various software development environments:</p>
        <h2>Front-End Web Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I used HTML and CSS for two years while developing content for internal CMS at Heartland Payment Systems.</li>
          <li>I taught myself how to create multiple Chrome Extensions for internal website monitoring at Heartland Payment Systems.</li>
          <li>I utilized knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery to develop the content and functionality of these extensions. x Along with the Bootstrap front-end framework, I designed custom front-end content using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the Incentivator, a task assignment and incentive application that was to be used for tracking chores assigned to my children.</li>
          <li>As a final project for my front-end web development work with Code Louisville, I am developing a personal website at http://sachtleben.me that will showcase my experience, projects, and skills. I have developed all content within the site, and I have designed the site using responsive CSS.</li>
          <li>At Stored Value Solutions, I administered an enterprise service management software suite called ServiceNow. I was responsible for developing front-end form content as well as custom JavaScript code that interfaces with ServiceNow's core processes to deliver enhancements to the site through the use of Client Scripts, Business Rules, Access Control Lists, and many other various system objects</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Back-End Web Development</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>During my last year at Sullivan University, I taught myself the fundamentals of PHP to create a functioning back-end framework for a bug-tracking system that was submitted as a final group project.</li>
          <li>I conceptualized, designed, and built using PHP the back-end framework of the Incentivator, a task assignment and incentive application that was to be used for tracking chores assigned to my children.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Database Programming</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I used my knowledge of MySQL to design and implement a relational database that was used in conjunction with the PHP back-end framework for a bug-tracking system.</li>
          <li>Within a short time frame, I taught myself many T-SQL queries such as complex SQL queries for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting database information, stored procedures used for complex query utilization, views for controlled data queries performed by other users, and triggers to allow updates of other table data when the data of a table is updated.</li>
          <li>I applied knowledge of T-SQL to provide reporting services for Heartland Payment Systems for three years. Along with SSMS for ad-hoc query execution, I utilized Visual Studio 2012 and SSRS 2008 R2, Crystal Reports 2011, and VBA within Excel to generate dynamic, informative reporting of business metrics.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Other Programming Languages</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I have created multiple test projects within C# for various classroom projects.</li>
          <li>I developed a C# version of a "Savings Calculator" that displayed the number of dollars Heartland Payment Systems passed through to its merchants from Durbin Amendment savings based on calculated dollar savings per second. This was built to so I could estimate the date that the savings counter would hit milestone dollar amounts.</li>
          <li>I developed a small pong-style video game in C# as a final solo project at Sullivan University</li>
          <li>I have created some small Android applications utilizing Java and XML markup for content layout.</li>
          <li>Using Java and libGDX, I created a small 2D game called Police Box.</li>
          <li>I have utilized online tutorials for other games developed in Java to further my knowledge of the language.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Version Control Systems</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I have acquired a fundamental understanding of Git and how it can be used for proper version control within the confines of the software development lifecycle. I have used Git to track various personal projects of mine, and they can be viewed at my <a href="https://github.com/joshuasachtleben">GitHub Page</a>
